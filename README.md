## Analysing sentiment about different transit topics near Eugene, Oregon

   
### Nico Gouveia

For this project I want to see which areas in Eugene or Lane County have positive imperssions of transit options besides than cars. This would be useful for developing transit alternatives. Idealy the scripts created could be used in other locations.

I will query tweets using Twitter's developer API and the Tweepy package. I will likely use census tract shapefiles and Matplotlib in order to present my results. For data manipulation and analysis, I will likely use Pandas, Geopandas, Numpy, Sklearn, and Natural Language Toolkit. I may use NLTK's VADER tool.

I plan to split my project into three sections - querying relevant tweets and preparing them for analysis, analysing them (performing sentiment analysis) and finally plotting them or representing this information in an appealing way.

I expect this project to have some geographical correlation with opinion of different transit options but I'm not sure what the extent or scale of this correlation will be. Hopefully each part of my project is versatile enough that I can swap out locations or topics in order to find something interesting.
